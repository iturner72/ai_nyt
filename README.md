# AI NYT

This is a project meant to conquer this bounty set by [Bajajis](https://warpcast.com/balajis.eth/0x218b92a7). Update (4/20/2022): I took a fat L on this project, but I use the site multiple times a week, so I'll continue working on it. It's very fun and I love the idea of farcaster clients. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iturner72/ai_nyt.git
```

### Client 
```bash
cd client && npm i
```

```bash
npm start
```

### Server
```bash
cd server && cargo run
```

### Hubble Node
This is where we query the casts from. It's not clear where we will host this
yet... hubble_url constantly changing in .env for this reason.

### Farcaster Docs
These are good [docs](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/).
