\subsection*{Monday, 06/24/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item working on hubble endpoint replication for casts. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tuesday, 06/25/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item fixed dates on this document (not really but listed this month as july
        for a while, weeks still way off).
    \item riced my color scheme mostly yesterday (it fixed me), so will just
        continue with casts endpoint. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Wednesday, 06/26/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item i am nvim maxing rn, playing around with octa to create and merge prs
        from nvim. it is so slick and updates on save in real time since it uses
        gh cli. 
    \item really just procrastinating, but at least prs will be fun now. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Thurdsay, 06/27/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item i realized that i should have deployed this project from the
        beginning. to help with this blunder i've decided to rewrite my fork of
        \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/ishan0102/engblogs}{ishan's}}
        \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://engblogs.dev}{engblogs.dev}} to leptos.
    \item this way i can break this other project since it's much simpler for
        now and doesn't involve farcaster at all. 
    \item we are back (Figure~\ref{fig:bb_we_back})
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=12cm]{bb_we_back}
            \captionsetup{labelfont=bf, textfont=it}
            \caption{we back}
            \label{fig:bb_we_back}
        \end{figure}
    \item i had python woes last i checked on this project so we'll see how this
        goes when trying to update things haha
    \item we are so back (Figure~\ref{fig:bb_we_back_again}
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=12cm]{bb_we_back_again}
            \captionsetup{labelfont=bf, textfont=it}
            \caption{we so back}
            \label{fig:bb_we_back_again}
        \end{figure}
    \item wow it worked first try, let's goooo. okay this isn't deployed but
        I'll do that next. feels good to revive this project as well in like a
        few hours (i can't search or anything yet, but basic stuff works)

    \clearpage
    \item i am back (in the evening, above was last night technically) working
        on the networktimes leptos rewrite.
    \item added some new models for a new cast list
        \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/iturner72/thenetworktimes/issues/3}{feature}}.
    \item this feature is just replicating the existing hubble routes used in
        the production site.
    \item i think i will start using github issues to compliment this notes
        document. this stuff is off the dome, and the issue is a more structured
        object. perhaps i can add the relevent pdf pages to the prs once
        features are done, not sure on that yet.
\end{itemize}
