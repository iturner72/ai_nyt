\begin{itemize}
    \item damn i need to commit more here!
    \item working on cast list and cast entry merging finally. implemented very
        lazy lazy loading. i still don't have shuttle postgres thing set up so i
        have to make all these fetches randomly, so i'd like to keep them to a
        minimum for user data.
    \item this lazy load feature was fun since it gave me an excuse to use some
        \texttt{web_sys} stuff related to interactive observers.
    \item i basically have it so that only the first 8 cast entries load data
        immediately (user data, not cast body), and the rest are loaded as they
        become visible in the viewport.
    \item this was a breeze with this fine grained readtivity business honestly!
    \item the IntersectionObserver types are cracked since i can set a threshold
        for visibility (i used 10 percent in this feature). 
\end{itemize}
