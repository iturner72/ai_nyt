\begin{itemize}
    \item working on new thread creation animations, would be good to practice
        highlightjs integration on a small chat completion. 
    \item i've written like 3 or 4 different stream handlers, i like this SSE
        one the best so far, but it's really really naive and should make better
        use of mpsc::channel.
    \item in previous stream handlers i would store each chunk (thought that was
        dumb, maybe it wasn't), then a few chunks here and there, now none at
        all unless the stream is complete.
    \item i realize this probably doesn't work for the highlightjs package since
        it requires the fully formed code block to work (also if user refreshes
        they lose the completion)
    \item much to fix, i'll rework stream once i figure out 0.7 migration (i've
        been lazy on this)
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
