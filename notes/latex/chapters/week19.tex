\subsection*{Saturday, 9/05/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item this has just evolved into my personal project notes for me to yap to
        myself.
    \item i still really like thenetworktimes idea, but am too lazy to seperate
        smaller project notes into other documents.
    \item i'll just roll with this and work on the bryptoblogs site since it's
        been down for a month or so at this point (rip)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sunday, 9/06/2024}
\begin{itemize}

        haven't set up a con job to automate this stuff oopsie.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Monday, 9/16/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item working on new thread creation animations, would be good to practice
        highlightjs integration on a small chat completion. 
    \item i've written like 3 or 4 different stream handlers, i like this SSE
        one the best so far, but it's really really naive and should make better
        use of mpsc::channel.
    \item in previous stream handlers i would store each chunk (thought that was
        dumb, maybe it wasn't), then a few chunks here and there, now none at
        all unless the stream is complete.
    \item i realize this probably doesn't work for the highlightjs package since
        it requires the fully formed code block to work (also if user refreshes
        they lose the completion)
    \item much to fix, i'll rework stream once i figure out 0.7 migration (i've
        been lazy on this)
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
