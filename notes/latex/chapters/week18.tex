\begin{itemize}
    \item shit i need to grind harder what am i doing.
    \item anyways, let's try to deploy leptos brypto blogs now, server is just
        down hahaha have not pointed domain back to old vercel one.
    \item okay, fr, fundementally i never understood what \texttt{cargo leptos
        watch} (from the  
        \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos}{cargo leptos}}
        build tool) was doing.
    \item i would do a few release build just to test the compile times, but i
        never did anything more.
    \item looking at the fly io deployment example from the book, i simply
        forgot to incorporate the tailwind build step and thought it would just
        magically work somehow. luckily i can just run the help command or read
        the examples.
    \item wow... i've many skill issues related to nginx!!!
    \item much to think about.
\end{itemize}
