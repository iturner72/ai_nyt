\begin{itemize}
    \item man i can not count, but we are back. leptos rewrite going well,
        realized i need to use something like
        \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-diesel}{deadpool-diesel}}} since i
        already have some diesel endpoints i want to repurpose and apparently
        this deadpool crate integrates well with tokio (at least better than
        plain r2d2 from diesel)
    \item i will play around with this for article storage and more
    \item looks like deadpool is the move, will explore latest changes to crate
        and try to implement this over \texttt{r2d2}
    \item channels still sus as hell the way i use create_effect, but we will
        send it for now (i don't know how to use \texttt{loom} crate or similar yet to
        test async / concurrent stuff)
\end{itemize}

    \item i am getting skill issued when trying to convert to deadpool from
        vanilla postgres r2d2 setup haha. might just stick with what i had
        before and if the stream fails halfway by user refresh or anything else,
        that's just tough buddy\footnotemark
        \footnotetext{this will destroy me inside}
    \item ...
