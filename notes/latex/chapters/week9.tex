\begin{itemize}
    \item man i can not count, but we are back. leptos rewrite going well,
        realized i need to use something like
        \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-diesel}{deadpool-diesel}}} since i
        already have some diesel endpoints i want to repurpose and apparently
        this deadpool crate integrates well with tokio (at least better than
        plain r2d2 from diesel)
    \item i will play around with this for article storage and more
    \item looks like deadpool is the move, will explore latest changes to crate
        and try to implement this over \texttt{r2d2}
\end{itemize}
