\subsection*{Monday, 07/17/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item man i can not count, but we are back. leptos rewrite going well,
        realized i need to use something like
        \texttt{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-diesel}{deadpool-diesel}}} since i
        already have some diesel endpoints i want to repurpose and apparently
        this deadpool crate integrates well with tokio (at least better than
        plain r2d2 from diesel)
    \item i will play around with this for article storage and more
    \item looks like deadpool is the move, will explore latest changes to crate
        and try to implement this over \texttt{r2d2}
    \item channels still sus as hell the way i use create_effect, but we will
        send it for now (i don't know how to use \texttt{loom} crate or similar yet to
        test async / concurrent stuff)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tuesday, 07/18/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item i am getting skill issued when trying to convert to deadpool from
        vanilla postgres r2d2 setup haha. might just stick with what i had
        before and if the stream fails halfway by user refresh or anything else,
        that's just tough buddy\footnotemark
        \footnotetext{this will destroy me inside}
    \item wait, this \textit{is} possible with vanilla diesel, i was doing this 
        months ago since it was somehow easier than keeping track of each chunk 
        in a vector until the end haha
    \item ...
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item finally got deadpool-diesel working and made a ding
        Figure~\ref{fig:fearless_concurrency}

\subsection*{Thursday, 07/20/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item added url encoding to allow user to upload code snippets or special
        characters basically. this should prevent bugs where a cast can have
        some strange character which breaks the request to create an article.
    \item we will see what the limits of what i can pass into the url for a get
        request can be. if this becomes an issue i can always change it up or
        even experiment with web sockets rather than sse if the complexity is
        not too crazy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Saturday, 07/22/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item testing ffmpeg vid and audio
    \item it works lets go
    \item will continue reworking the hubble endpoints from react project in
        leptos components
    \item might even rework the chat stream component to use server functions
        properly
    \item i think in order to get the chat working where messages are actually
        chained together, i need to rework my \texttt{conversations} module.
    \item since i want to use some structs on the client side, i need create new
        structs for client only (without any server crates in the ssr block of
        the cfg_if macro), then new structs which share these common types for
        the server with the database functionality.
    \item this way the new structs \texttt{ThreadView}, \texttt{MessageView},
        and \texttt{NewMessageView} are safe to use client and server side,
        while diesel specific structs \texttt{Thread}, \texttt{Message}, and
        \texttt{NewMessage} are only compiled for ssr.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sunday, 07/23/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item getting absolutely cucked by a simple server function implementation.
        i straight up can't get them to work dawg, but i want to be fancy and
        use them so i will keep trying.
    \item i think i should for sure abstract away the thread fetching logic to
        its own component, this may be the number one source of my woes
        recently.
    \item we are back (Figure~\ref{fig:threads_leptos_init})
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=7cm]{threads_leptos_init}
            \captionsetup{labelfont=bf, textfont=it}
            \caption{init threads component}
            \label{fig:threads_leptos_init}
        \end{figure}
    \item essentially, i forgot that i could import the \texttt{AppState} 
        struct like i do in main function to aquire a db connection. the more 
        annoying thing was the error formatting. i needed to create a custom 
        \texttt{ThreadError} enum to
        categorize different types of errors (PoolError, DatabaseError,
        InteractionError) but they could not be type cast properly. this didn't
        properly convert them all the \texttt{ServerFnError} which leptos server
        functions must return. unlucky, so i needed to create a
        \texttt{to_server_error()} function which explicitly converts
        \texttt{ThreadError} to \texttt{ServerFnError}.
    \item these problems easier to tackle once i stopped trying to do everything
        in the \texttt{chat.rs} component.
\end{itemize}
