\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/queazyg}{Q}} is helping me with ai nyt server.
    \item I am hard stuck on messages so perhaps we will crack it together.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{04/21/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Got diesel initialized in the project for storing articles, have not
        yet tested the ORM yet, I'll do this soon. 
    \item I was distracted by the reactions feature for the network times. This
        was really easy to add, and I styled it indigo-300 or something like
        this. I've never seen a social site have this color like, so it's
        interesting at least.
    \item You can't yet press the like, this will work once I finally figure out
        how to make the app a valid signer for users.
\end{itemize}
