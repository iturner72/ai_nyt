\begin{itemize}
    \item work on bb to refresh the summaries using gpt-4o-mini with moar
        tokens. Should be good to go, but I loop through all poasts currently,
        so if I get rate limited before finishing, there's no way to restart
        from where I left off without indexing so I'll hold off on the full
        send.
    \item I'll probably add date range or something to fix this issue.
\end{itemize}
