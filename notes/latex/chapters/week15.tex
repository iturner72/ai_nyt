\begin{itemize}
    \item added bio to profile component, now need to add the casts by fid
        endpoint, i don't even think the current site has this, but i built it
        months ago on the old hubble server so i'll just use it now.
    \item i tried to add the casts by fid endpoint in another server function on
        the profile page but failed miserably and was just left with a hanging
        request and i am not good enough with leptos to understand why hahaha. i
        suspect i am doing too much in a single component and i should just
        create a new one similar to the home page, render the cast list but pass
        in the cast from the user rather than the channel for each cast in the
        list.
    \item ...

\begin{itemize}
    \item added writers room idea i've been thinking about for a while, much to
        do, and change to merge the old blocking article gen with this new
        streaming idea which allows for fast iteration on an idea for an
        article, or meme, or whatever really.
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
