\subsection*{Monday, 8/26/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item added simple grep over the users desired channels (hardcoded for now).
    \item i really need to stop putting of the shuttle thing and just implement
        it. it's probably really hard and this is going to stink but whatever,
        i'm sure i'll learn a ton.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tuesday, 8/27/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item spent the night tinkering with 
        \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim}{avante}} 
        (it clears)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Wednesday, 8/28/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item going to try to get syntax highlighting working (this adds a more js
        slop (cries) but whatever highlight-js is great). maybe i'll treesitter
        max and do it server side but that's a later thing.
    \item got is sort of working lessgo, i get cross site scripting warning on
        refresh though so will address this later
\end{itemize}
