\subsection{Sunday, 12/08/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item refuse to setup cron job on fly io so I'm just making the RSS fetch
        stuff adaptive based on the \texttt{last_processed} timestamp.
    \item truncate title and in rss test ui, also truncate and wrap lines so
        company progress divs don't expand and contract willy nilly.
    \item add cache invalidation so user can see new poasts immediately.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monday, 12/09/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item add debounced search over poast titles and summaries 
\end{itemize}
