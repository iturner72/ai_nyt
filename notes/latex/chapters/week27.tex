\subsection{Monday, 12/31/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item added dynamic year range select for summary refresh on bb, this was so
        annoying, now studying tokio cancelation tokens since I would like to
        add a cancel button and I got skill issued hard.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Saturday, 01/04/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item i might be back (shoutout to tokio-utils (CancellationToken)).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sunday, 01/05/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item it looks like i'm back, i should write tests for these endpoints (this
        will be the end of me)
\end{itemize}
